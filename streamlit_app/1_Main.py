This Streamlit application may appear to be a simple showcase of trucks I find interesting, 
but its true purpose is to serve as a hands-on environment for mastering full-stack data analytics workflows. 
The project bridges frontend interactivity with backend data control, helping to solidify key concepts in modular application design.
